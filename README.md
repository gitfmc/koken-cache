# koken-cache
Caching script for Koken installation. Allows pre-caching of HiDPI images, consequently improving website loading performance.

# Installation

Place the `pre-cache.php` file in your Koken installation folder. If you access Koken installation at `http://example.com/`, then the pre-cache.php file should be located at `http://example.com/pre-cache.php` where `i.php` is also located.

Make sure you change the root directory of your koken installation. If your Koken installation (local path) is `/var/www/html`, then root dir should be `'html'`.

Execute the script by running `php pre-cache.php` in the command line.
